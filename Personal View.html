    <p class="p_intro" id="p_intro1">In our daily life, knowing the exact position of ourselves could become very important. For example, in HKUST, students especially freshman find it very difficult to find the right classroom. Although people could get some information from online map and the Expression Station, they still can’t know where they are easily. The online map need a connection to the Wi-Fi so people have to slow down and wait their mobile phone to get online. The Expression Stations are fixed there thus cannot serve us whenever we want. However the system we are developing in this program does not need a solid connection to Wi-Fi and have its client on mobile device. This definitely helped people a lot.
    </p>
    <p class="p_intro" id="p_intro2">
    Furthermore, I think this technique has a very promising future. In reality, apart from people, some devices also need to know their position and their surrounding conditions so that they can work efficiently. For instance, I learned that a kind of robot cleaner becomes more and more popular recently. They are designed so smartly that they can deal with any kind of floor conditions like corners, steps and pillars when cleaning. However, little of them can work as fast as a human being because sometimes they just move around in the same place. I think is a good idea to equip the robot cleaner with the technology we are developing so that the robot can “know” its position in the house and make a better plan on its route which will improve the performance. Many other robots also need localization techniques in different ways. All in all, some magical thing is waiting for us in the future.

    <p class="p_intro" id="p_intro3">
    The majority task in this research program is to develop novel and advanced localization techniques for indoor users and I find this kind of work is quite attractive for me. First of all, I have an experience of learning some related knowledge such as android programming, database management, webpage design and so on. Although these are not enough in a real commercial setting, I will keep learning, practicing and improving myself. Secondly, I am really interested in doing research on indoor localization and mobile computing. I can’t help to seeing how the knowledge in the book will turn into solid outcome, how to design a program that can meet everybody’s requirement and how to collect data from different sources and analyze them to get the position information. Doing research is always my dream and I hope I can accumulate some precious experiences from this program.

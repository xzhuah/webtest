I prepared my Curriculum Vitae in the form of html files. The first webpage is "My CV.html" and you can use the navigation bar to switch to other files. I used an external css file and javascript file to decorate my html files so please make sure your broswer support them. The background should be yellow green and if you find it is white on your broswer, you may need to try another broswer.
